# Reverse a linked list
 Amazon and Microsoft ask you to show an algorithm that will reverse a singly-linked list, that is, a list that is made of nodes between which there is a unidirectional association as in the following image.

1. to reverse the linked list
2. create method on the linked list class to reverse the order of the pointers.

```javascript
//3.
make a class Node {
  constructor() {
    this.value;
    this.next;
  }

  make a managing class LinkedList{
constructor() {
  this.head;
  this.tail;
  this.length;
}

reverse() {
  // edge cases = 1. empty list(length), 2.time complexity is constant,


  return this;
}

  }
}
```
